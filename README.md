## Background
Paperless working was implemented in Portsmouth in Spring 2023. This used Aria for Radiation Oncology (_Aria RadOnc_) to manage patients Radiotherapy notes in addition to the clinical pathway, managed by the Aria module _CarePaths_.

After a year of working with Aria and CarePaths, as part of continuous improvement, and the Trusts Strategic True North Metric of ["All of us able to improve"](https://porthosp.sharepoint.com/sites/PlanningandProgrammes/SitePages/True-North-Metrics.aspx), a small piece of work is required to review the existing CarePaths and identify any efficiencies that can be made. 

## Scope
### In Scope
* Review CarePath Lag-times
* Method of Booking (e.g. water-marking)
* Cross-cover arrangements
* Site Specific task and appointment times
* Review Encounter list items to reflect any changes
* re-treatment management

### Out Of Scope
* Dr Job Plans

## Key Objectives

1. Review CarePaths to improve current issues
2. Review time taken for tasks and how they are scheduled / Appointment lengths.
3. Review and update Encounter lists to accommodate changes and remove superfluous items. 

## Phases / Milestones

The project will be approached in phases. Each treatment site will be assessed and implemented individually. Approaching the sites in the following order: 

1. [Urology](./Urology.md)
2. Lung
3. H&N
4. Breast
5. Palliative
6. Gynae
7. Superficial
8. All others

After the first site has been completed, the project will be reviewed, and improvements implemented for subsequent sites. 

## Assumptions

It is assumed that:
* Dr's availability can be updated onto Aria in a timely manner
* Auto Scheduling continues to work once capacity is reached
* Dr planing time is sufficient for required tasks
* Other ongoing work looking at Dr job plans will not have a significant impact on this project
