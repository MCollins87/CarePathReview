## Time needed for Clinician tasks. 

Audit performed by MU, asking CCO's to complete table with length of time needed to complete outlining of particular sites. This was combined with the number and type of patients through Aria in the last 12 months. 

Findings from this audit found that Urology Dr's need a combined total of 8 half-day planning slots per week, or 18hrs/week. 

For Urology in particular, the CCO's identified the following plan types:

| Plan Type			| Time needed	|
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Prostate			| 45min (0.75hr)|
| Prostate + ln		| 2hr			|
| Prostate bed		| 45min (0.75hr)|
| Prostate Bed + ln	| 2hr			|
| PACE Prostate only| 1.5hr			|
| PACE + Node		| 3hr			|
| Bladder 			| 45min (0.75hr)|
| Simple Pall.		| 30min (0.5hr)	|
