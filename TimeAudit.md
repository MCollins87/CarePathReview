# Dr Contouring Time Audit

To review if time required for Dr's to complete their required planning tasks is sufficient, an audit was conducted in two stages. First, a survey of all CCO's was conducted for the estimated time to plan each site and disease. Secondly, a report was produced from Aria providing the number of patients and their plan type for the period October 2023 to September 2024.

Combine with number of plans over the year  October 2023 - September 2024, the resulting time required is below. It is worth noting to allow for Dr's annual leave and study leave, the weeks in a year are 42.

|       | Total Hrs/year  | Hrs/week | Days/week | 1/2 days/week | Number of Drs |
| ----- | --------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | --- |
| **Colorectal**   | 157   | 3.74    | 0.75      | 2   | 4 |
| **Urology**      | 757.75  | 18.04 | 3.6       | 8   | 7 |
| **Breast** | 516 | 12.29 | 2.46 | 5 | 5 |
| **CNS** | 57.75 | 1.38 | 0.28 | 1 | 2 |
| **Gynae** | 153 | 3.64 | 0.73 | 2 | 2 |
| **Head and Neck** | 394.5 | 9.39 | 1.88 | 4 | 3 |
| **Lung** | 466 | 11.09 | 2.22 | 5 | 4 |
| **Upper GI** | 20 | 0.48 | 0.09 | 1 | 2 |
| **SABR Mets** | 58 | 1.38 | 0.28 | 1 | 1|
| **Other / Palliative** | 154.5 | 2.96 | 0.59 | 2 |

Assuming each Dr has one half day outlining session per site they cover, this table shows that Urology, Head and Neck, and Lung are each one planning session a week short of available clinicians. 

These sites however have Dr's who only specialise in these sites, allowing for more time to plan radiotherapy treatments.
